<h1>&#9830&#9827&#9829&#9824 Welcome! &#9824&#9829&#9827&#9830</h1>
<p>My name is Karter, welcome to my website! It might look a bit rudimentary right now, but I'm still learning. I hope
    to get this polished up once I learn more. I'm thinking of mostly just using this as a personal website to test stuff
    out and show the world what I'm working on. </p>
<h3>About me: Using prompts from <a href="https://blog.gratefulness.me/things-to-write-about-yourself/">here.</a></h3>
<p>My favorite colors are purple and green. If I could have any super power, it would be the ability to save and
    reload. If I could talk to one animal, I'd talk to a sea creature and ask them if there's truly anything to be 
    scared of in the darkest depths of the ocean. I'm more of an early bird than a night owl. I used to stay up late, but 
    now I basically go to bed at around the same time. Sometimes I'll wake up really early in the morning, though, and
    at that point I might as well just stay up, since it's not like I'll be able to fall back asleep anyway. When I was 
    around 11, I mastered the pogo stick. It took forever, but it was fun.
